# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

Note:
Deleting the .git folder may cause problems in your git repository. If you want to delete all your commit history but keep the code in its current state, it is very safe to do it as in the following:

Checkout

git checkout --orphan latest_branch
Add all the files

git add -A
Commit the changes

git commit -am "commit message"
Delete the branch

git branch -D master
Rename the current branch to master

git branch -m master
Finally, force update your repository

git push -f origin master
PS: this will not keep your old commit history around
